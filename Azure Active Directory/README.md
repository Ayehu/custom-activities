# Azure Active Directory Activities
Activities repository to manage Azure Active Directory security groups and members.

This type of group differs from the Office365 group.

##  Office365 group
Office 365 groups are used for collaboration between users, both inside and outside your company. With each Office 365 group, 
members get a group email and shared workspace for conversations, files, and calendar events, and a Planner.

## Security groups
Security groups are used for granting access to Office 365 resources, such as SharePoint... 
They can make administration easier because you need only administer the group rather than adding users to each resource individually.

Security groups can be configured for dynamic membership in Azure Active Directory, 
allowing group members or devices to be added or removed automatically based on user attributes such as department, location, or title;
