# How to obtain Azure API credentials

Go to https://portal.azure.com

-> Azure Active Directory ![Azure AD](master/images/AD.png)

-> App registration ![App reg](master/images/AppReg.png)

-> Click on your application

-> On the right you'll find the API credentials ![credentials](master/images/credentials.png)

The app secret can be found under "Certificates & secrets" but it's hidden and not accessible. However, you can create a new one if you forgot/lost the previous.
