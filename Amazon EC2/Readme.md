These activities leverage the AWS CLI tool.  Ensure that the user running the Ayehu NG Manager service is able to run the AWS CLI tool.  Follow the steps in the <b>"Installing AWS CLI.pdf"</b> document.
<br><br>
Note that if you choose to go the Python/pip route for installing the AWS CLI tool, you must ensure that you install Python for all users so that the user running the Ayehu NG Manager Service has Python in its path.  This typically requires a system reboot to take effect.  You can find more information on this process in the <b>"Installing Python.pdf"</b> document.
<br><br>
<b>These activities are designed as supplements to the existing AWS EC2 activities that ship with Ayehu NG out-of-the-box.</b>
