# Docker Activities

To run Docker activities, it is necessary access remotely your docker server, follow this [tutorial](https://success.docker.com/article/how-do-i-enable-the-remote-api-for-dockerd) to setup.  
### ATTENTION!!
This configuration must open up your docker app to anyone.
So, ensure that you setup the remote machine firewall to allow only ayehu client to have access.
