<h1>VMware Custom Activities</h1>

These activities are designed to be a supplement to the default VMware activities that ship out-of-the-box.  These activities leverage PowerCLI and thus a supported version of PowerCLI must be installed on the Ayehu server (or Executor server) on which these activities are executed.
<br><br>
Just as with the built-in VMware activities, these are designed to be pointed at either vCenter or an individudal ESXi host.
<br><br>
The officially supported version of VMware PowerCLI is <b>6.5.0R1</b> and can be downloaded here:
