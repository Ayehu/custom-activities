<h1>VMware Custom Activities</h1>

These activities are designed to be a supplement to the default VMware activities that ship out-of-the-box.  These activities leverage PowerCLI and thus a supported version of PowerCLI must be installed on the Executor Server on which these activities are executed.

The officially supported version of VMware PowerCLI is <b>6.5.0R1</b> and can be downloaded here:
