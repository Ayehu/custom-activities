This endpoint can only be used with a [user-level API key](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/using-the-api#section-generating-a-personal-rest-api-key) or a key generated through an OAuth flow. This will not work if the request is made with an account-level access token.

Users are members of a PagerDuty account that have the ability to interact with Incidents and other data on the account.
