<h1>SplunkGetDynamicAlertEvents</h1>
This activity will dynamically retrieve any fields from a Splunk Alert Event by SID.  This activity is useful for those using transformation with their Splunk Alerts.  If the standard <b>SplunkGetAlertEvents</b> activity is not returning the expected output, use this activity instead.
