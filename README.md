# Custom Activities Repository
Public activities repository for Ayehu users to share their content.

Custom Activites can be created using the Activity Designer, which provides a fliexble and accessible solution to customers who wish to create certain activites to fit their specific needs.

If our library of 500+ activites does not give you the exact solution you're looking for, then you can use the Activity Designer to create activites to perform dozens of actions.

In this way, you can be completely self-sufficient, without the need for Ayehu development to be involved. Your needs, your timeline, your custom activity!

We invite you to use the custom activites, modify them to suit your needs, get involved in the community, and then contribute back whatever new activities you develop so that others can enjoy and learn from your hard work and build upon it to enhance it even further.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome and appreciated! For instructions about adding/modifying activities please see our [Custom Activities Contribution Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).
