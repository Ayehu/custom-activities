# Custom Activities Repository
In response to growing user requests to add greater flexibility to the Ayehu NG automation platform, Ayehu has released NG v1.5. This release significantly expands the scope of what you can automate in your enviorment, all from a single pane of glass, making it a real game-changer in the IT orcestration and automation market.

The Activity Designer provides a fliexble and accessible solution to customers who wish to create certain activites to fit their specific needs.

If our library of 500+ activites does not give you the exact solution you're looking for, then you can use the Activity Designer to create activites to perform dozens of actions. Start from our provided activties and modify the code of the activity to suit your needs.

In this way, you can be completely self-sufficient, without the need for Ayehu development to be involved. Your needs, your timeline, your custom activity!

We invite you to use the custom activites, modify them to suit your needs, get involved in the community, and then contribute back whatever new activities you develop so that others can enjoy and learn from your hard work and build upon it to enhance it even further.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome and appreciated! For instructions about adding/modifying activities please see our [Custom Activities Contribution Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).
