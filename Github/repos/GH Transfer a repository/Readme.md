<br>Transfer a repository</br>
<br>A transfer request will need to be accepted by the new owner when transferring a personal repository to another user. The response will contain the original `owner`, and the transfer will continue asynchronously. For more details on the requirements to transfer personal and organization-owned repositories, see [about repository transfers](https://help.github.com/articles/about-repository-transfers/).</br>
