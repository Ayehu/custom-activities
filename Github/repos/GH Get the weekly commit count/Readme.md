<br>Get the weekly commit count</br>
<br>Returns the total commit counts for the `owner` and total commit counts in `all`. `all` is everyone combined, including the `owner` in the last 52 weeks. If you'd like to get the commit counts for non-owners, you can subtract `owner` from `all`.

The array order is oldest week (index 0) to most recent week.</br>
