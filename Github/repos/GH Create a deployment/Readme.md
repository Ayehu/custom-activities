<br>Create a deployment</br>
<br>Deployments offer a few configurable parameters with certain defaults.

The `ref` parameter can be any named branch, tag, or SHA. At GitHub we often deploy branches and verify them
before we merge a pull request.

The `environment` parameter allows deployments to be issued to different runtime environments. Teams often have
multiple environments for verifying their applications, such as `production`, `staging`, and `qa`. This parameter
makes it easier to track which environments have requested deployments. The default environment is `production`.

The `auto_merge` parameter is used to ensure that the requested ref is not behind the repository's default branch. If
the ref _is_ behind the default branch for the repository, we will attempt to merge it for you. If the merge succeeds,
the API will return a successful merge commit. If merge conflicts prevent the merge from succeeding, the API will
return a failure response.

By default, [commit statuses](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/statuses) for every submitted context must be in a `success`
state. The `required_contexts` parameter allows you to specify a subset of contexts that must be `success`, or to
specify contexts that have not yet been submitted. You are not required to use commit statuses to deploy. If you do
not require any contexts or create any commit statuses, the deployment will always succeed.

The `payload` parameter is available for any extra information that a deployment system might need. It is a JSON text
field that will be passed on when a deployment event is dispatched.

The `task` parameter is used by the deployment system to allow different execution paths. In the web world this might
be `deploy:migrations` to run schema changes on the system. In the compiled world this could be a flag to comp</br>
