<br>Get a commit</br>
<br>Returns the contents of a single commit reference. You must have `read` access for the repository to use this endpoint.

**Note:** If there are more than 300 files in the commit diff, the response will include pagination link headers for the remaining files, up to a limit of 3000 files. Each page contains the static commit information, and the only changes are to the file listing.

You can pass the appropriate [media type](https://developer.github.com/v3/media/#commits-commit-comparison-and-pull-requests) to  fetch `diff` and `patch` formats. Diffs with binary data will have no `patch` property.

To return only the SHA-1 hash of the commit reference, you can provide the `sha` custom [media type](https://developer.github.com/v3/media/#commits-commit-comparison-and-pull-requests) in the `Accept` header. You can use this endpoint to check if a remote reference's SHA-1 hash is the same as your local reference's SHA-1 hash by providing the local SHA-1 reference as the ETag.

**Signature verification object**

The response will include a `verification` object that describes the result of verifying the commit's signature. The following fields are included in the `verification` object:

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| `verified` | `boolean` | Indicates whether GitHub considers the signature in this commit to be verified. |
| `reason` | `string` | The reason for verified value. Possible values and their meanings are enumerated in table below. |
| `signature` | `string` | The signature that was extracted from the commit. |
| `payload` | `string` | The value that was signed. |

These are the possible values for `reason` in the `verification` object:

| Value | Description |
