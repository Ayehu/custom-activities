    "name": "GH Compare two commits",
    "description": "Both `:base` and `:head` must be branch names in `:repo`. To compare branches across other repositories in the same network as `:repo`, use the format `:branch`.\n\nThe response from the API is equivalent to running the `git log base..head` command; however, commits are returned in chronological order. Pass the appropriate [media type](https://developer.github.com/v3/media/#commits-commit-comparison-and-pull-requests) to fetch diff and patch formats.\n\nThe response also includes details on the files that were changed between the two commits. This includes the status of the change (for example, if a file was added, removed, modified, or renamed), and details of the change itself. For example, files with a `renamed` status have a `previous_filename` field showing the previous filename of the file, and files with a `modified` status have a `patch` field showing the changes made to the file.\n\n**Working with large comparisons**\n\nThe response will include a comparison of up to 250 commits. If you are working with a larger commit range, you can use the [List commits](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/commits/#list-commits) to enumerate all commits in the range.\n\nFor comparisons with extremely large diffs, you may receive an error response indicating that the diff took too long\nto generate. You can typically resolve this error by using a smaller commit range.\n\n**Signature verification object**\n\nThe response will include a `verification` object that describes the result of verifying the commit's signature. The following fields are included in the `verification` object:\n\n| Name | Type | Description |\n| ---- | ---- | ----------- |\n| `verified` | `boolean` | Indicates whether GitHub considers the signature in this commit to be verified. |\n| `reason` | `string` | The reason for ver",
