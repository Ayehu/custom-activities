<br>Compare two commits</br>
<br>Both `:base` and `:head` must be branch names in `:repo`. To compare branches across other repositories in the same network as `:repo`, use the format `:branch`.

The response from the API is equivalent to running the `git log base..head` command; however, commits are returned in chronological order. Pass the appropriate [media type](https://developer.github.com/v3/media/#commits-commit-comparison-and-pull-requests) to fetch diff and patch formats.

The response also includes details on the files that were changed between the two commits. This includes the status of the change (for example, if a file was added, removed, modified, or renamed), and details of the change itself. For example, files with a `renamed` status have a `previous_filename` field showing the previous filename of the file, and files with a `modified` status have a `patch` field showing the changes made to the file.

**Working with large comparisons**

The response will include a comparison of up to 250 commits. If you are working with a larger commit range, you can use the [List commits](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/commits/#list-commits) to enumerate all commits in the range.

For comparisons with extremely large diffs, you may receive an error response indicating that the diff took too long
to generate. You can typically resolve this error by using a smaller commit range.

**Signature verification object**

The response will include a `verification` object that describes the result of verifying the commit's signature. The following fields are included in the `verification` object:

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| `verified` | `boolean` | Indicates whether GitHub considers the signature in this commit to be verified. |
| `reason` | `string` | The reason for ver</br>
<br>Method: Get</br>
<br>OperationID: repos/compare-commits</br>
<br>EndPoint:</br>
<br>/repos/{owner}/{repo}/compare/{base}...{head}</br>
