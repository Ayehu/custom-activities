<br>Get a thread subscription for the authenticated user</br>
<br>This checks to see if the current user is subscribed to a thread. You can also [get a repository subscription](https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/watching/#get-a-repository-subscription).

Note that subscriptions are only generated if a user is participating in a conversation--for example, they've replied to the thread, were **@mentioned**, or manually subscribe to a thread.</br>
