<br>Get team member (Legacy)</br>
<br>The "Get team member" endpoint (described below) is deprecated.

We recommend using the [Get team membership for a user](https://developer.github.com/v3/teams/members/#get-team-membership-for-a-user) endpoint instead. It allows you to get both active and pending memberships.

To list members in a team, the team must be visible to the authenticated user.</br>
