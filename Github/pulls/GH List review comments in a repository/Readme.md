<br>List review comments in a repository</br>
<br>**Note:** Multi-line comments on pull requests are currently in public beta and subject to change.

Lists review comments for all pull requests in a repository. By default, review comments are in ascending order by ID.

**Multi-line comment summary**

**Note:** New parameters and response fields are available for developers to preview. During the preview period, these response fields may change without advance notice. Please see the [blog post](https://developer.github.com/changes/2019-10-03-multi-line-comments) for full details.

Use the `comfort-fade` preview header and the `line` parameter to show multi-line comment-supported fields in the response.

If you use the `comfort-fade` preview header, your response will show:

*   For multi-line comments, values for `start_line`, `original_start_line`, `start_side`, `line`, `original_line`, and `side`.
*   For single-line comments, values for `line`, `original_line`, and `side` and a `null` value for `start_line`, `original_start_line`, and `start_side`.

If you don't use the `comfort-fade` preview header, multi-line and single-line comments will appear the same way in the response with a single `position` attribute. Your response will show:

*   For multi-line comments, the last line of the comment range for the `position` attribute.
*   For single-line comments, the diff-positioned way of referencing comments for the `position` attribute. For more information, see `position` in the [input parameters](https://developer.github.com/v3/pulls/comments/#parameters-2) table.

The `reactions` key will have the following payload where `url` can be used to construct the API location for [listing and creating](https://developer.github.com/v3/reactions) reactions.</br>
