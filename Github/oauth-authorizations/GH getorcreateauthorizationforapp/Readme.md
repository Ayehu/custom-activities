<br>Get-or-create an authorization for a specific app</br>
<br>**Deprecation Notice:** GitHub will discontinue the [OAuth Authorizations API](https://developer.github.com/v3/oauth_authorizations/), which is used by integrations to create personal access tokens and OAuth tokens, and you must now create these tokens using our [web application flow](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/authorizing-oauth-apps/#web-application-flow). The [OAuth Authorizations API](https://developer.github.com/v3/oauth_authorizations/) will be removed on November, 13, 2020. For more information, including scheduled brownouts, see the [blog post](https://developer.github.com/changes/2020-02-14-deprecating-oauth-auth-endpoint/).

**Warning:** Apps must use the [web application flow](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/authorizing-oauth-apps/#web-application-flow) to obtain OAuth tokens that work with GitHub SAML organizations. OAuth tokens created using the Authorizations API will be unable to access GitHub SAML organizations. For more information, see the [blog post](https://developer.github.com/changes/2019-11-05-deprecated-passwords-and-authorizations-api).

Creates a new authorization for the specified OAuth application, only if an authorization for that application doesn't already exist for the user. The URL includes the 20 character client ID for the OAuth app that is requesting the token. It returns the user's existing authorization for the application if one is present. Otherwise, it creates and returns a new one.

If you have two-factor authentication setup, Basic Authentication for this endpoint requires that you use a one-time password (OTP) and your username and password instead of tokens.
