<br>Reset an authorization</br>
<br>**Deprecation Notice:** GitHub will replace and discontinue OAuth endpoints containing `access_token` in the path parameter. We are introducing new endpoints that allow you to securely manage tokens for OAuth Apps by using `access_token` as an input parameter. The OAuth Application API will be removed on May 5, 2021. For more information, including scheduled brownouts, see the [blog post](https://developer.github.com/changes/2020-02-14-deprecating-oauth-app-endpoint/).

OAuth applications can use this API method to reset a valid OAuth token without end-user involvement. Applications must save the "token" property in the response because changes take effect immediately. You must use [Basic Authentication](https://developer.github.com/v3/auth#basic-authentication) when accessing this endpoint, using the OAuth application's `client_id` and `client_secret` as the username and password. Invalid tokens will return `404 NOT FOUND`.</br>
<br>Method: Post</br>
<br>OperationID: apps/reset-authorization</br>
<br>EndPoint:</br>
<br>/applications/{client_id}/tokens/{access_token}</br>
