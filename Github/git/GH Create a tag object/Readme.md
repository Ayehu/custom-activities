<br>Create a tag object</br>
<br>Note that creating a tag object does not create the reference that makes a tag in Git. If you want to create an annotated tag in Git, you have to do this call to create the tag object, and then [create](https://developer.github.com/v3/git/refs/#create-a-reference) the `refs/tags/[tag]` reference. If you want to create a lightweight tag, you only have to [create](https://developer.github.com/v3/git/refs/#create-a-reference) the tag reference - this call would be unnecessary.
