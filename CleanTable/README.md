<h1>CleanTable</h1>
This activity's only input field is the source table variable.  It will iterate through each row and column, removing all trailing and leading whitespace from each cell.
<br><br>
This activity <span style="text-decoration:underline">will not overwrite the original table variable</span>, and so you must refer to the <b>CleanTable</b> activity in order to reference the new, cleaned table (e.g. <b>%cleanTable1%</b>).
