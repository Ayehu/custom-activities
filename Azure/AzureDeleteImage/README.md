How to find information of required fields to CREATE Snapshot on Azure?

-- Answer:
 
1. TenantID, ClientID, ClientSecret: In the start interface after logging into Azure click: Azure Active Directory -> App registrations -> New registration (If not) -> (Name of registrations). 
After performing the above steps you will see Application (client) ID, Directory (tenant) ID, Object ID.
Inside (Name of registration) select: Certificates & secrets -> New client secret to get ClientSecret.

2. SubscriptionID: If you do not have "Resource Group", please create an item in the Resource Group section in the interface. Clicking on the newly created item will display the SubscriptionID.
