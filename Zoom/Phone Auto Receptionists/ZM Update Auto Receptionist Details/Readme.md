Update Auto Receptionist Details 

An auto receptionist answers calls with a personalized recording and routes calls to a phone user, call queue, common area phone, or voicemail. An auto receptionist can also be set up so that it routes calls to an interactive voice response (IVR) system to allow callers to select the routing options.
